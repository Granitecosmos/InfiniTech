# InfiniTech
Have you ever wanted to max out all your pawns' research skills? Have you ever wondered why that moron who made the Modular Power Armor mod added research skill as requirements for the good stuff?

**Well fear not, for I bring you InfiniTech!**

All it does is add an additional research. Have fun completing it!

## Balance
What, have you been snorting that yayo again? This has nothing to do with game balance, dude. Where do these junkies keep coming from anyway?

## Compatibility
I honestly can't think of anything that would be incompatible with this.
